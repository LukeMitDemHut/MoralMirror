    <h2>What This Study Was About</h2>
    <p>This study investigated how large language models can generate individualized ethical assessments based on
        minimal examples. Your responses in Phase 1 were used to create personalized simulations, which you then
        evaluated in Phase 2.</p>

    <p>The goal is to understand whether AI systems can accurately capture individual moral reasoning patterns, which
        has implications for developing more personalized and ethically-aligned AI assistants.</p>
