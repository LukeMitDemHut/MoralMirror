    <h1>✓ Phase 1 Complete!</h1>

    <p>Thank you for completing the first phase of the study. You have successfully responded to all 10 scenarios.</p>

    <p><strong>What's next:</strong> We've prepared the materials for Phase 2 based on your responses.</p>

    <p>In Phase 2, you will evaluate different responses to moral scenarios. You will rate each response on two
        dimensions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Content:</strong> Whether the response reaches the same moral conclusion you would reach (ignoring
            how it's written)</li>
        <li><strong>Style:</strong> Whether the way the response reasons and justifies the decision resembles how you
            would explain it (even if you agree or disagree with the conclusion)</li>
    </ul>
